## **Description**

For this project I modified code to create a command-line application. The application will  allow a manager or employee to dynamically generate a employee team template. The user will be able to access the application and enter each employee's basic information into it. A question to determine each employee's role within the team will be asked. Then the user will be prompted to enter role specific information based on the type of employee being added to the team. An HTML page will be generated with all of the information that has been gathered from the user. Then the user will be able to open a webpage that displays all of the team members and their relevent information.
